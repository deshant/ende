ende classic
====

first android project
---------------------

ENDE Classic is an android app which demonstrates some simple implementations of algorithms used when cryptography came into existence.
The schemes used are simple to implement.
These ciphers can easily be used to encrypt text with the help of mere pen and paper, yet some of them proved to be fairly secure and hard to break at that time.

The application demonstrates the implementation of 4 ciphers, Atbash, Caesar, Vigenere, and Vigenere Auto-Key.

The application is easy to use, and you can copy the ENcrypted or DEcrypted text to clipboard.

The aim is to learn working on android platform, that is why i gave no attention to code optimization, removing code redundancy or other performance/exception issues.

The code is self explanatory.
