DESCRIPTION:

ENDE is an android app which demonstrates some simple implementations of algorithms used when cryptography came into existence. The schemes used are simple to implement.
These ciphers can easily be used to encrypt text with the help of mere pen and paper, yet some of them proved to be fairly secure and hard to break at that time.
